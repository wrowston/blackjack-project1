# Blackjack Rules
The goal of blackjack is to get the value of your cards equal to 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the player goes over, then it is a bust and the dealer wins. The values of the cards correspond to their numerical value from 2-10. All face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count 10 and the Ace either 1 or 11, as the user desires. Highest score below 22 wins the round, but a Blackjack (Ace and a card whose value is 10) beats all other combination of cards. If the user wins the hand, the pay-out is 1:1. If the user wins with blackjack, the pay-out is 3:2.
